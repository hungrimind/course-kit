The app we build is a great starting point for any application which needs the user to login, and have access to the user information within the application.\n\nThe database we will be using is Firebase and it will be built with state management in mind, using Riverpod.\n\nLearn with interactive and highly visual step by step lessons to guide you through the complete process of not just building the app, but understanding how to think like an expert developer.","headline":"Ultimate Login System","sectionType":"header","subheadline":"Learn to build the ultimate login system with Riverpod and Firebase"},{"id":"69","file":"lib/pages/signin.dart","type":"flutter","value":"class _SignInState extends State<SignIn> {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      body: Column(\n        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n        children: [\n          const TextField(\n            keyboardType: TextInputType.emailAddress,\n            decoration: InputDecoration(\n              hintText: 'Enter your email',\n              border: InputBorder.none,\n              contentPadding:\n                  EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 15, horizontal: 20),\n            ),\n          ),\n          const TextField(\n            obscureText: true,\n            decoration: InputDecoration(\n              hintText: 'Password',\n              border: InputBorder.none,\n              contentPadding:\n                  EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 15, horizontal: 20),\n            ),\n          ),\n          OutlinedButton(\n            onPressed: () {},\n            child: const Text(\"Sign In\"),\n          ),\n        ],\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}","content":"Next, we will add an `OutlinedButton` at the bottom, and you will notice the next problem we will face. In the `onPressed` argument, we need to retrieve the value of the email and password, so we can pass it over to Firebase. But how do we do that?\n\n> Notice that the editor gives an error that the button can't be `const`. That's because the whole Scaffold is `const`. This requires you to move the `const` lower in the widget tree to each `TextField`.\n","heading":"Add Button","highlight":"26-29","sectionType":"slide","previewImage":"courses/flutter/login/textfield-4.png"},{"id":"134","content":"### Congratulations\n\n**That's it!** You have now created a fully functional login system using Flutter. \n\nIf you enjoyed this course, I would really appreciate it if you shared it with your friends or even just told them about [hungrimind.com](https://www.hungrimind.com).
